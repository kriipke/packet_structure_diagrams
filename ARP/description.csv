Field Common Name, Field Name, Size (bytes), Description
Hardware Type,HRD,2,"This field specifies the type of hardware used for the local network transmitting the ARP message; thus, it ials o identifies the type of addressing used."
Protocol Type,PRO,2,"This field is the complement of the Hardware Type field, specifying the type of layer three addresses used in the message. For IPv4 addresses, this value is 2048 (0800 hex), which corresponds to the EtherType code for the Internet Protocol."
Hardware Address Length,HLN,1," Specifies how long hardware addresses are in this message. For Ethernet or other networks using IEEE 802 MAC addresses, the value is 6."
Protocol Address Length,PLN,1,"Again, the complement of the preceding field; specifies how long protocol (layer three) addresses are in this message. For IP(v4) addresses this value is of course 4."
Opcode,OP,2,"This field specifies the nature of the ARP message being sent. The first two values (1 & 2) are used fore regular ARP. Numerous other values are also defined to support other protocols that use the ARP frame format, such as RARP, some of which are more widely used than others."
Sender Hardware Address,SHA,variable (equals value in HLN field)," The hardware (layer two) address of the device sending this message (which is the IP datagram source device on a request, and the IP datagram destination on a reply, as discussed in the topic on ARP operation)."
Sender Protocol Address,SPA,variable (equals value in PLN field),"The IP address of the device sending this message."
Target Hardware Address,THA,variable (equals value in HLN field),"The hardware (layer two) address of the device this message is being sent to. This is the IP datagram destination device on a request, and the IP datagram source on a reply)"
Target Protocol Address,TPA,variable (equals value in PLN field),"The IP address of the device this message is being sent to."
